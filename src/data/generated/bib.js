        "abstract": "This paper aims to provide latest research results on consumer attitudes and behaviors about smartphone recycling. In particular, the study considers China as an example and reviews the country's recent progress in legislation and business practice in smartphone recycling. The study relies on a national survey to identify the patterns and trends in Chinese consumers' recycling attitudes and behaviors. Our results show that on top of incentive and convenience, information security is the number one requirement for consumers to recycle their smartphones. Additionally, although China has made significant progress in improving social environment and people's consciousness for phone recycling, more people still choose to store their waste smartphones at home. Moreover, the impact of recycling service on the sales of new phones is also discussed in the context of closed-loop supply chain design. As an exploratory attempt to understand smartphone recycling from the consumers' perspectives, this article presents critical factors influencing consumers' attitudes and behaviors in China, and sheds new lights on future academic research directions as well as on managerial applications and policy-making.",

        "abstract": "As efforts to empower consumers to repair home appliances increase, analysis of the behavioural biases driving premature replacement is needed. Serious games, such as the EVIDENT serious game, provide a promising means to explore these biases and aid consumer energy decision making. However, for serious games to be effective, they must be acceptable and usable, and accurately reflect real-world contexts. As such, this manuscript seeks to 1) identify the real-world factors impacting decisions to repair or replace home appliances; and 2) explore the usability and acceptability of the EVIDENT serious game as a means to examine energy decision making. Six interactive workshops were conducted (n",

        "abstract": "From the kitchen to the bathroom, homes are now equipped with various technological devices like smart vacuums, intelligent mirrors, digital thermostats, wearables, and voice-controlled assistants such as Amazon Alexa. This surge in ubiquitous technologies contributes to the growing concern of electronic waste, or e-waste, globally. Research focuses on developing strategies for e-waste reduction, and is considering a range of approaches on governmental, industrial and societal levels. To gain a comprehensive understanding of smart device repair, our research was structured into several distinct tasks, each supported by semi-structured interviews, each tailored to explore different facets of repair behaviours and decision-making. A total of fifteen one-on-one study sessions were conducted as part of this research. The study\u2019s findings will be presented in three primary sections, each shedding light on distinct aspects of repair practices and decision-making. Along with the aforementioned results around current repair practices, repair decision making drivers and future expectations, our paper offers two significant contributions to human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice. First, we place our findings in a broader context, anchoring them within the existing body of literature on HCI, repair practices, and the IoT. Second, we leverage our findings along with wider literature to conclude our paper with a set of design recommendations that align with current actual user practice around IoT repair; is inclusive of user expectations around every day reparability in future IoT; and enables user decision making around IoT repair thereby making IoT reparability an accessible and equitable process.",

        "abstract": "Significant progress has been achieved in China's electronic waste (e-waste) management, since a series of laws and regulations based on extended producer responsibility began to be enforced in 2011. In 2016, China's second batch of e-waste catalogue, which includes the mobile phone, was given priority. This study intended to propose potential approaches for addressing obsolete mobile phones management by examining residents' returning and recycling preferences and awareness in a typical city \u2013 Foshan, China, via face-to-face questionnaire surveys. The residents expressed their keen awareness of potential hazards caused by mobile phones and actively supported collection activities. However, 62.1% of residents stored their obsolete mobile phones at home, while only 4.7% of the mobile phones ended up in regulated treatment enterprises. The results indicated that most residents had much higher expectation on benefits from their obsolete mobile phones than their actual value, although only 1/3 of them declared the benefits would hindered their participation in collection activities. The formal collection channels, the convenience of collection facilities and guarantee of information security would also accelerate the collected amount. Additionally, this study investigated the structure of collection system and the relevant flow of mobile phones, and shed light on implications towards future studies and managerial implementation.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to explore consumers\u2019 intention of recycling obsolete mobile phone through formal channels in China. Taking Jiangsu Province as an example, the survey results revealed that although nearly half of consumers prefer to save their obsoleted mobile phones at residence, those who are willing to participate in recycling prefer formal recycling channels instead of informal ones. To explore the determinants of formal recycling intention from the perspective of consumers\u2019 psychological characteristics, an integrative model based on the theory of planned behavior was established, in which the effect of consumers\u2019 privacy concern was thoroughly explored. The results indicated that recycling attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and moral norm are all positively influential factors. Inconsistent with prior studies, consumers\u2019 privacy concern is found to have a direct positive rather than a negative effect on formal recycling intention. It also has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between subjective norm and formal recycling intention. Therefore, to promote consumers\u2019 formal recycling behavior of obsolete mobile phones, a series of measures are proposed to influence these psychological factors in the model. First, a positive social atmosphere for participation in formal recycling should be vigorously created. Then, further efforts are required to increase the publicity and availability of formal recycling channels. Furthermore, joint efforts should be made for privacy information protection during formal recycling processes, including establishing certification standards for secure data erasure, further routinizing recycling processes and establishing a credible image to obtain consumers\u2019 trust by formal recycling enterprises, etc.",

From this perspective, this study presents how artificial intelligence can help achieve this goal. Therefore, at the beginning of this article, we begin with an introduction and brief review of the literature on the subject. Our research procedure involved the combination of qualitative and quantitative forms of research using mixed methods. In this study, we presented and analyzed five chatbot solutions used in the field of the circular economy. The analysis of these five chatbots helped us design, in the second part of this paper, the procedures for data collection, training, development, and testing of a chatbot using various natural language processing (NLP) and deep processing (DP) techniques. Additionally, we include discussions and some conclusions regarding all aspects of the subject to see how they can help us in future studies. Furthermore, our future research with this topic will have as the goal the effective construction of a chatbot dedicated to the circular economy.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, management of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and the related waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is a growing concern around the world and clearly an open issue to tackle in order to move towards a more circular economy. The goal of this review paper is to analyze and summarize research conducted exploring behaviors connected with purchases, extension of useful life, and management of end of life of electrical and electronic equipment. The results highlight several research exploring the determinants of WEEE recycling behavior, also in relation with different practices (e.g., online recycling); on the other hand other typologies of behaviors are less analyzed in the literature (e.g., purchase of used EEE products, donation of EEE products, participation in WEEE takeback activities established by firm operating in this sector, etc.). Moreover, the results suggest that the theoretical model adopted in many studies reveals its usefulness to predict the determinist of such circular consumer\u2019s behavior in relation to the purchase, extension of life, and end of life management of electrical and electronic products; however, in many cases, additional variables are needed to fully explain the behavior.",

It integrates multiple processes such as online inquiry and offline delivery. The complex online\u2013offline interaction makes residents\u2019 willingness to participate susceptible to external factors, hindering their behavior. To better transform residents\u2019 recycling intentions into behavior, this paper primarily uses a questionnaire survey to explore the intention\u2013behavior gap in e-waste online recycling participating. Our findings show that residents\u2019 e-waste online recycling intention directly predicts their behavior, but the implementation plan plays a partial mediating role between them. Additionally, perceived value and platform interactivity moderate the impact of e-waste online recycling intention towards participation behavior. Subsequent in-depth interview analysis further also confirmed these findings. The study contributes to understanding residents\u2019 online recycling behaviors and fostering the sustainable development of this model.",
